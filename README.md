This workshop consists of three half-day sessions, combining lecture and exercises to teach participants many of the useful R packages for visualization. We will learn how to create many of the most published type of plots in bioinformatics scientific literature.

Participants must have access to a computer with a recent version of R, and Rstudio installed, as well as a reliable internet connection.

The registration fee is $350 for UC students, postdocs, staff and faculty, $500 for Non-UC academic or non-profit participants and $650 for other participants. We accept credit cards, as well as UC Davis recharge accounts, for payment. We are pleased to be able to offer three group pricing bundle options for labs with multiple registrants: 15% off registration for groups of 3-5, 25% off registration for groups of 6-10, and custom instructional packages for groups larger than 10. If you are interested in one of these pricing options, please contact us at training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu for a custom coupon code.
